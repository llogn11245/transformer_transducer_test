Welcome to SpeeQ's documentation!
=================================

Welcome to the documentation for **SpeeQ**, a speech recognition framework for
Python that is pronounced as “speekiu”. SpeeQ provides a powerful tool for
developers and researchers to experiment with and train different speech
recognition models quickly and easily. With SpeeQ, you can easily run various
pre-implemented model architectures with just a few lines of code, making it an
ideal choice for those who want to quickly prototype and test different
speech recognition models.
